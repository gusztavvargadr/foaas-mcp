# FOAAS MCP Server - Development Roadmap

## üéØ Project Goals

Build an MCP server that exposes FOAAS (Fuck Off As A Service) functionality to AI clients, with demonstrations in:
- **GitHub Copilot in VS Code** (with custom instructions and prompts)
- **GitHub Copilot on GitHub** (Copilot Chat / Agent)

Target timeline: **2-3 days** for public release on GitHub and LinkedIn.

---

## üìã Key Decisions & Findings

### Architecture
- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP (not stdio) for remote access support
- **Deployment**: Docker containers for security isolation
- **Distribution**: npm package + Docker image

### Tool Design
- **4 category-based tools** (not individual operations):
  1. `express_appreciation` - Thanks/praise (3 operations)
  2. `decline_request` - Rejections (3 operations)
  3. `tell_off` - Direct confrontations (5 operations)
  4. `express_frustration` - Universal dismissals (3 operations)
- **Total**: 14 FOAAS operations mapped to 4 intuitive tools

### Testing Focus
- GitHub Copilot in VS Code with customizations:
  - Custom instructions (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
  - Workspace prompts
  - Different conversation contexts
- GitHub Copilot on GitHub.com
- Docker deployment validation

### Documentation
- Phase 0.1: [API Research](./phase-0.1-api-research.md)
- Phase 0.2: [Packaging & Transport](./phase-0.2-packaging-transport.md)
- Phase 0.3: [Implementation Plan](./phase-0.3-implementation-plan.md)
- Phase 0.3: [Implementation Completion](./phase-0.3-implementation-completion.md)

---

## Phase 0: PoC / Research Stage üî¨

**Goal**: Quick proof of concept with minimal viable functionality to evaluate feasibility and approach.

### 0.1 FOAAS API Research (1-2 hours) ‚úÖ

- [x] Explore https://foaas.io/operations endpoint
- [x] Test 15 selected operations across 4 categories
- [x] Document response formats (JSON structure)
- [x] Test with different Accept headers
- [x] Note any rate limiting or API constraints

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - All 15 selected operations tested and documented.

**Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ API is simple and consistent: `{ "message": "...", "subtitle": "- ..." }`
- ‚úÖ No rate limiting observed (client-side throttling recommended)
- ‚úÖ Operations naturally group into 4 categories:
  1. **Appreciation & Praise** (3 ops): thanks, awesome, legend
  2. **Dismissals & Rejections** (3 ops): because, zero, bye
  3. **Direct Confrontations** (5 ops): off, gfy, chainsaw, dalton, keep
  4. **Broad Dismissals** (3 ops): everyone, flying, asshole
- ‚úÖ Category-based tool design recommended (4 tools vs 15 individual tools)

**Documentation**: [phase-0.1-api-research.md](./phase-0.1-api-research.md)

---

### 0.2 MCP Packaging Research (1-2 hours) ‚úÖ

- [x] Review MCP server packaging requirements for GitHub Copilot
- [x] Understand npx vs npm install distribution methods
- [x] Research GitHub Copilot MCP configuration (VS Code & GitHub.com)
- [x] Determine packaging and distribution strategy
- [x] Check MCP SDK documentation for best practices
- [x] Research Docker deployment for security
- [x] Understand stdio vs HTTP transport options

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Recommended approach: **Docker + Streamable HTTP transport**

**Key Decisions**:
- üê≥ **Transport**: Streamable HTTP (not stdio)
  - Reason: Supports both local and remote clients (GitHub Copilot on github.com, ChatGPT)
  - Security: Docker isolation
  - Flexibility: Can be accessed via HTTP from anywhere
- üì¶ **Packaging**: npm package + Docker image
  - npm for easy installation: `npx foaas-mcp --http`
  - Docker for security: `docker run -p 3000:3000 foaas-mcp`
- üîí **Security**: Built-in DNS rebinding protection, CORS, rate limiting
- üìù **Note**: Future enhancement to pure HTTP transport (remove stdio entirely)

**Documentation**: [phase-0.2-packaging-transport.md](./phase-0.2-packaging-transport.md)

### 0.3 Minimal PoC Implementation (2-3 hours)

- [ ] Initialize basic Node.js/TypeScript project
- [ ] Install `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and dependencies
- [ ] Create simple MCP server with 4 category-based tools:
  - `express_appreciation` - Sarcastic/genuine thanks (maps to: thanks, awesome, legend)
  - `decline_request` - Reject requests/changes (maps to: because, zero, bye)
  - `tell_off` - Direct confrontation (maps to: off, gfy, chainsaw, dalton, keep)
  - `express_frustration` - Universal dismissal (maps to: everyone, flying, asshole)
- [ ] Implement basic HTTP client for FOAAS API
- [ ] Set up Streamable HTTP transport with Express
- [ ] Create basic Dockerfile
- [ ] Test server runs locally via HTTP

**Goal**: Working MCP server with category-based tools that can be accessed via HTTP

---

### 0.4 GitHub Copilot Integration Test (1-2 hours)

- [ ] Package PoC for local testing
- [ ] Configure in VS Code GitHub Copilot settings:
  ```json
  {
    "github.copilot.chat.mcp.servers": {
      "foaas": {
        "transport": "http",
        "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Test basic interactions:
  - [ ] "Tell Bob to f**k off"
  - [ ] "Thank the code reviewer sarcastically"
  - [ ] "Decline this feature request"
- [ ] Test with VS Code customizations:
  - [ ] Custom Copilot instructions (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
  - [ ] Workspace-specific prompts
  - [ ] User-level Copilot settings
  - [ ] Different conversation contexts
- [ ] Test Docker deployment:
  - [ ] `docker build -t foaas-mcp .`
  - [ ] `docker run -p 3000:3000 foaas-mcp`
  - [ ] Verify same client config works
- [ ] Document setup process and tool discovery
- [ ] Capture screenshots/demo recordings
- [ ] Validate approach before full implementation

**Goal**: Confirm MCP server works with GitHub Copilot and responds to custom instructions

### 0.5 Go/No-Go Decision

**Evaluate**:
- Does MCP server communicate properly?
- Can GitHub Copilot discover and use tools?
- Is FOAAS API suitable for this use case?
- Are there any blockers?

**Decision**: ‚úÖ Proceed to Phase 1 or üîÑ Adjust approach
