## Goal

Create a realistic demo repository showcasing FOAAS MCP integration with GitHub Copilot coding agent in real-world scenarios.

## Proposed Setup

### Repository Structure
- README with demo instructions and scenarios
- Multiple test issues with different labels
- Sample code/content for PR demonstrations
- Configured MCP server in repository settings
- Example workflows and templates
- **Generated content**: Issues, code, and PRs created programmatically
