# PoC & Research

**Completed**: October 2025 (Phase 0)

## Goal

Validate feasibility of building an MCP server for FOAAS with GitHub Copilot integration.

## Research Areas

### FOAAS API Research
- Explored https://foaas.io/operations endpoint
- Tested 15 selected operations across 4 categories
- Documented response formats (simple JSON structure)
- Verified no rate limiting issues

### MCP Packaging Research
- Reviewed MCP server packaging requirements
- Explored npx vs npm vs Docker distribution
- Researched GitHub Copilot MCP configuration
- Investigated stdio vs HTTP transport options

### Integration Testing
- Packaged minimal PoC for Docker
- Configured VS Code GitHub Copilot (`.vscode/mcp.json`)
- Tested basic interactions with tools
- Validated approach with custom instructions

## Key Findings

- **API simplicity**: Consistent JSON format `{ "message": "...", "subtitle": "- ..." }`
- **No rate limits**: Client-side throttling recommended but not required
- **Docker preferred**: Security and isolation benefits
- **stdio sufficient**: Simpler than HTTP for VS Code use case
- **Tool categories**: Operations naturally group into scenarios

## Go/No-Go Decision

âœ… **GO** - All validation criteria met:
- MCP server communicates properly (stdio transport)
- GitHub Copilot discovers and uses tools
- FOAAS API suitable for use case
- No technical blockers identified

## Impact

Provided confidence to proceed with full implementation and informed key architectural decisions (Docker-first, stdio-only).
