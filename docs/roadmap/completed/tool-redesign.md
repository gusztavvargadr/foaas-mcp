# Tool Redesign

**Completed**: October 26, 2025

## Goal

Simplify tool architecture by removing group tools with randomization and expanding to 23 individual scenario-based tools.

## Context

The original design included 4 group tools (`proper_*`) that randomly selected from a set of operations. This added complexity with inconsistent parameters and reduced the value of AI-powered tool selection.

## What Changed

- **Removed**: 4 group tools (`proper_appreciation`, `proper_rejection`, `proper_confrontation`, `proper_frustration`)
- **Added**: 9 new scenario-based tools for common dev situations
- **Total**: 23 individual tools with `foaas_*` prefix

## New Tools Added

**Code Review & Quality** (9 new tools):
- `foaas_logs` - Debugging and runtime errors
- `foaas_rtfm` - Documentation questions
- `foaas_think` / `foaas_thinking` - Questionable code decisions
- `foaas_shutup` - Bikeshedding and endless debates
- `foaas_look` - Code review requests
- `foaas_ridiculous` - Absurd requirements
- `foaas_understand` - Unclear requirements
- `foaas_cool` - Sarcastic approval

## Benefits

- **Consistent parameters**: All tools have predictable input schemas
- **AI selection**: Better demonstration of MCP's smart tool selection
- **Simpler architecture**: 1 tool = 1 FOAAS operation
- **Precise responses**: AI picks contextually perfect tool vs. random selection
- **Better scenarios**: Tools organized by development situations

## Impact

- 23 total tools (up from 18)
- Scenario-based documentation (bug reports, code reviews, PRs)
- Cleaner tool registration and schema design
- Enhanced demonstration value for MCP capabilities
