# Security Monitoring & Maintenance

**Status**: Backlog

## Goal

Establish regular security monitoring for Docker images and npm dependencies to ensure ongoing security posture.

## Context

Current state: Zero npm vulnerabilities, Debian Bookworm Slim base. Need automated monitoring to maintain this over time.

## Proposed Implementation

### Automated Vulnerability Scanning

**npm Dependencies:**
- Run `npm audit` in CI/CD pipeline
- Fail builds on high/critical vulnerabilities
- Weekly scheduled scans (even without code changes)
- Automated dependency update PRs (Dependabot)

**Docker Image:**
- Integrate Trivy or similar scanner in CI/CD
- Scan base image for CVEs
- Scan final built image
- Block deployment on critical findings
- Regular base image updates

### GitHub Security Features

**Dependabot:**
- Enable security updates
- Enable version updates (optional)
- Configure update schedule
- Auto-merge minor/patch updates (with tests)

**Security Advisories:**
- Enable GitHub Security Advisories
- Monitor for new CVEs
- Private disclosure process

**Code Scanning:**
- GitHub CodeQL (optional for TypeScript)
- Detect security patterns
- Regular scheduled scans

### Monitoring Schedule

**Daily:**
- CI/CD runs on every commit (npm audit)

**Weekly:**
- Scheduled security scan (even without changes)
- Review Dependabot PRs
- Check for base image updates

**Monthly:**
- Full security audit
- Review and update security policy
- Update SECURITY.md if needed

### Response Process

1. **Vulnerability Detected:**
   - Assess severity and impact
   - Check for patches/updates
   - Test fixes in development
   - Deploy update quickly

2. **No Patch Available:**
   - Evaluate workarounds
   - Consider alternative dependencies
   - Document known issues
   - Monitor for updates

3. **Base Image CVEs:**
   - Check Debian security updates
   - Rebuild with updated base
   - Test thoroughly
   - Deploy new image

## GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly
  workflow_dispatch:      # Manual trigger

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: npm audit
        run: npm audit --production
      
      - name: Trivy scan
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          image-ref: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:latest
          severity: HIGH,CRITICAL
```

## Documentation

### SECURITY.md
- Supported versions
- How to report vulnerabilities
- Response timeline
- Security update policy
- Contact information

### Security Badge
- Add security scan badge to README
- Show current security status
- Link to security policy

## Tools to Consider

**Vulnerability Scanning:**
- Trivy (Docker images)
- Snyk (npm + Docker)
- npm audit (built-in)
- GitHub Dependabot (automated)

**Monitoring:**
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Dependabot alerts
- CodeQL (optional)

## Benefits

- Proactive vulnerability detection
- Automated dependency updates
- Maintain security posture
- Quick response to issues
- User confidence

## Current Security Status

âœ… **Current (v0.1.0):**
- Zero npm vulnerabilities
- Debian Bookworm Slim (good CVE management)
- Non-root user execution
- No network exposure (stdio only)
- Regular TypeScript/Node.js updates
