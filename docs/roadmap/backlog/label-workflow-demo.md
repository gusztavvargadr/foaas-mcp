# Label-Based Workflow Demo

**Status**: Backlog

## Goal

Demonstrate automated workflows using GitHub labels to process issues and create roadmap backlog items via pull requests.

## Context

Show how FOAAS MCP can integrate with GitHub Actions and labels to automate issue processing and roadmap management.

## Proposed Workflow

### Issue Processing with Labels
- Label issues with categories (e.g., `feature`, `bug`, `enhancement`)
- Trigger GitHub Actions on label changes
- Use Copilot coding agent to process labeled issues
- Automatically create roadmap backlog files
- Open PRs with new backlog items

### Example Flow
1. User creates issue with description
2. Apply label: `roadmap:backlog`
3. GitHub Action triggers
4. Copilot coding agent:
   - Reads issue content
   - Creates markdown file in `docs/roadmap/backlog/`
   - Opens PR with new backlog item
5. Human reviews and merges PR

### Label System
- `roadmap:next` - Move to active work
- `roadmap:backlog` - Add to backlog
- `roadmap:completed` - Mark as done
- `demo:needed` - Needs demonstration
- `docs:update` - Documentation update

## Benefits

- Automate roadmap maintenance
- Community contribution workflow
- Consistent backlog format
- Reduce manual file creation
- Track feature requests systematically

## Implementation

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Trigger on label events
- Authenticate with GitHub token
- Call Copilot coding agent API
- Create branch and PR automatically

### Templates
- Issue template for feature requests
- Backlog item template
- PR template for automation

### Configuration
- Label definitions and colors
- Workflow permissions
- Agent configuration

## Considerations

- Rate limiting on GitHub API
- Security of automated PRs
- Review process for automated content
- Error handling and notifications
- Cost of Copilot API usage
