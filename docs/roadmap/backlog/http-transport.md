# HTTP Transport Support

**Status**: Backlog (Future v2.0)

## Goal

Add optional HTTP/SSE transport support for remote MCP server access while maintaining stdio as default.

## Context

Current implementation uses stdio-only transport for security and simplicity. HTTP transport would enable remote access scenarios but requires careful security considerations.

## Proposed Features

### Transport Options
- stdio (default, current implementation)
- HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Optional authentication
- TLS/HTTPS support

### Security Requirements
- Rate limiting
- Authentication/authorization
- Input sanitization (already done)
- CORS configuration
- Request size limits
- Timeout handling

### Configuration
- Environment variables for transport selection
- Port configuration
- Auth token management
- TLS certificate handling

## Use Cases

- Remote server deployment
- Cloud hosting
- Multi-user scenarios
- API integration
- Web-based clients

## Trade-offs

### Benefits
- Remote access capability
- More flexible deployment
- Web client support
- API integration options

### Costs
- Increased complexity
- Security attack surface
- Network exposure
- More testing needed
- Authentication overhead

## Considerations

- stdio sufficient for current use case
- Added complexity may not justify benefits
- Security burden increases
- Maintenance overhead
- Alternative: Keep separate HTTP fork if needed

## Implementation Strategy

If pursued:
1. Keep stdio as default
2. Add optional HTTP transport
3. Comprehensive security review
4. Additional testing for HTTP
5. Clear documentation on security
6. Consider separate Docker image variant
