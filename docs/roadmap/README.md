# FOAAS MCP Roadmap

This directory tracks the development roadmap for the FOAAS MCP server using an **incremental, append-only approach**.

## 📁 Directory Structure

```
docs/roadmap/
├── README.md          # This file - overview and workflow
├── next/              # Active work (2-5 items max)
├── backlog/           # Future ideas to be considered
└── completed/         # Historical reference (append-only)
```

## 🎯 Current Focus

The `next/` directory is currently **empty** - all active work completed!

Check [next/](next/) for any active development work.

## � Recommended Next: MVP Launch (v0.3.0)

**Goal**: Take the project public and get real user feedback

Core product is production-ready (v0.2.0 with 100% test coverage). Next steps focus on **visibility and accessibility** without compromising quality:

### 📝 Tier 1: Launch Essentials (High Impact, Low Effort)
**Estimated Time**: 3-5 hours total

1. **[Repository Best Practices](backlog/repository-best-practices.md)** (~2-3 hours)
   - Add CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
   - Create issue and PR templates
   - Enable Dependabot and branch protection
   - Makes project "real" and trustworthy for external users
   - **Blocks**: Social media announcement (looks more professional)

2. **[Social Media Announcement](backlog/social-media-announcement.md)** (~1-2 hours)
   - LinkedIn post with demo content
   - X/Twitter thread with highlights
   - Gets eyes on the work, validates concept
   - **Requires**: Repository best practices, make repo public

### 🎨 Tier 2: Polish & Discovery (Medium Impact, Low-Medium Effort)
**Estimated Time**: 7-10 hours total

3. **[Demo Content Creation](backlog/demo-content.md)** (~3-4 hours)
   - 2-3 GIFs of VS Code usage
   - One 60-second demo video
   - Screenshots for README enhancement
   - Shows people HOW to use it (visual > text)
   - **Synergy**: Feeds into social media announcement

4. **[Demo Repository](backlog/demo-repository.md)** (~4-6 hours)
   - Public repo with MCP configuration
   - 5-10 sample issues with FOAAS responses
   - Example PRs with review comments
   - Lets people try without setup, validates real-world usage
   - **Bonus**: Becomes regression test environment

### 🎯 MVP Sprint: 2-3 Days to Public Launch

**Day 1**: Repository prep + Demo content  
**Day 2**: Demo repository + Polish  
**Day 3**: Launch announcements + Engagement

See [backlog/](backlog/) for additional future enhancements (can wait for v0.4.0+ based on user feedback).

## 🔄 Workflow

### CRITICAL: Always Consult the Roadmap

**Before starting any feature:**
1. ✅ Check `next/` to see what's currently in progress
2. ✅ Check `backlog/` to avoid duplicate work
3. ✅ Create a new file in `backlog/` if it's a new idea

**When starting work on a feature:**
1. Move the file from `backlog/` → `next/`
2. Add your name and start date to the file
3. Update status to "In Progress"

**When finishing a feature:**
1. Move the file from `next/` → `completed/`
2. Add completion date to the file
3. Update status to "Completed"
4. **Update current state in other docs** (README.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, TOOLS.md, etc.)

### Append-Only Philosophy

- ✅ **DO**: Add new files to track new work
- ✅ **DO**: Move files between directories as status changes
- ✅ **DO**: Add completion notes to finished features
- ❌ **DON'T**: Delete or heavily edit completed items
- ❌ **DON'T**: Keep updating a single roadmap file

**Why?** Git history tracks the journey. Completed items document decisions. Current docs reflect the present.

## 📝 Feature File Format

Keep it simple and consistent:

```markdown
# Feature Name

**Status**: Backlog / In Progress / Completed
**Started**: YYYY-MM-DD (if applicable)
**Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD (if applicable)

## Goal
One-sentence description of what this achieves

## Context
Why we're doing this, what problem it solves

## What Changed (for completed items)
Brief summary of implementation

## Benefits
What value this provides

## Considerations
Trade-offs, alternatives, or future thoughts
```

## 🎯 Project Vision

Build a production-ready MCP server that:
- Exposes FOAAS functionality to AI clients
- Demonstrates MCP protocol in action
- Prioritizes security and best practices
- Provides comprehensive documentation
- Integrates seamlessly with GitHub Copilot

## 📊 Current Status

**Latest Release**: v0.2.0 (October 27, 2025)
- ✅ 23 FOAAS tools with scenario-based design
- ✅ 222 unit tests with 100% code coverage
- ✅ Docker-first deployment (Debian Bookworm Slim)
- ✅ GHCR integration with automated CI/CD
- ✅ VS Code and GitHub Copilot coding agent support
- ✅ Zero npm vulnerabilities
